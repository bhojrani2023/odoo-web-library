Learning OWL framework -- Your First Component 

`Owl`is a JS library for building UI in Odoo web apps. 
    - constructed from small, reusable components: buttons, text, and images. 
        - owl allow these components to be combined and nested to create complex user interfaces. 
        - owl can be broken down into components, making it easy to create reusable UI elements. 

Components: UI building blocks 

<article> 
    <h1> My First Component </h1> 
    <ol> 
        <li>Components: UI Building Blocks </li> 
        <li>Defining a Component </li>
        <li>Using a Component </li> 
    </ol>
</article> 

Owl lets you encapsulate those elements: article, h1, ol into single component along with its markup, CSS, and JS into custom components.
You can customize how its rendered in many ways and control its interactivity so it can be distributed to be resuable.
